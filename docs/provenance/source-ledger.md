# Current implementation source ledger

Review date: 2026-09-06
Implementation rule: `REIMPLEMENT_FROM_CONCEPT`

This ledger describes the provenance of the current public implementation. It records evidence
and engineering decisions; it does not offer legal conclusions.

| Component | Status | Source category | Evidence or influence | Historical source copied? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Repository and package foundation | Implemented in Phase 4 | `CURRENT_ORIGINAL_IMPLEMENTATION` | Newly designed from the frozen public architecture and Python packaging conventions | No |
| Domain types and geometry | Implemented in Phase 4 | `CURRENT_ORIGINAL_IMPLEMENTATION` | Newly written value records; half-open rectangle arithmetic is a general convention | No |
| Path and public-serialization safeguards | Implemented in Phase 4 | `CURRENT_ORIGINAL_IMPLEMENTATION` | Newly written validation against portable relative-path and privacy requirements | No |
| Configuration validation and fingerprints | Implemented in Phase 4 | `CURRENT_ORIGINAL_IMPLEMENTATION` | Newly written strict dataclasses; SHA-256 and canonical JSON are standard-library mechanisms | No |
| Vocabulary index/fingerprint contract | Implemented in Phase 4 | `GENERAL_ALGORITHM` | Deterministic code-point ordering and SHA-256 over canonical JSON; no external code incorporated | No |
| Phase 4 tests and hygiene checks | Implemented in Phase 4 | `CURRENT_ORIGINAL_IMPLEMENTATION` | Newly written against current public contracts | No |
| NumPy | Used in Phase 4 | `EXTERNAL_LIBRARY` | Array type and shape/dtype validation; [official project](https://numpy.org/) | No |
| setuptools | Build dependency | `EXTERNAL_LIBRARY` | Standard `pyproject.toml` build backend; [packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/) | No |
| pytest and pytest-cov | Development dependencies | `EXTERNAL_LIBRARY` | Test execution and coverage reporting; [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/) | No |
| Ruff | Development dependency | `EXTERNAL_LIBRARY` | Linting and formatting; [Ruff documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) | No |
| GitHub Actions | CI configuration | `EXTERNAL_LIBRARY` | Stable checkout/setup actions and documented Python workflow conventions | No |
| Earlier OCR capability set | Requirements context only | `BEHAVIORAL_REFERENCE` | High-level workflow recorded separately in `behavioral-references.md` | No |

Planned libraries and their licensing/package implications are recorded in
`dependency-review.md`. Listing a dependency does not incorporate its source into this repository
or select a license for repository-owned code.
